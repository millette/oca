The [oca project](https://github.com/millette/oca) is an SVG explorer for the original `openclipart` project. Since <https://openclipart.org/> has been down for over 6 months, I thought I'd give it a shot. Visit the [tags page](/tags) for a list of about 100 tags used at least 50 times from the collection of over 8000 cliparts. _Hint: If you want every tag used at least once, see the [tags page with n=1](/tags?n=1) but don't tell anyone! Warning: that's more than 1000 tags._ From the `tags page`, you can browse all cliparts with a given tag. For instance, here are the [cliparts tagged with "work"](/tagged?tag=work). Finally, you'll reach a clipart page, such as the one for [scissors by Jon Phillips](/key?key=office/scissors_01.svg).
