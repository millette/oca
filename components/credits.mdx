#### Cliparts

</Summary>

Although <https://openclipart.org/> has been down for over 6 months, you can still find the original collection of 8000 cliparts dating back to 2005 at various sources. The project is currently using SVGs found in the [openclipart 0.18 package](https://packages.debian.org/source/jessie/openclipart). I'm pointing to Debian Jessie, but later versions are identical.

All SVGs are in the **public domain**.
