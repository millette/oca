### Welcome to the `oca` SVG explorer!

The [oca project](https://github.com/millette/oca) is an SVG explorer for the original `openclipart` project. Since <https://openclipart.org/> has been down for over 6 months, I thought I'd give it a shot.

Visit the [tags page](/tags) for a list of about 100 tags used at least 50 times from the collection of over 8000 cliparts.

_Hint: If you want every tag used at least once, see the [tags page with n=1](/tags?n=1) but don't tell anyone! Warning: that's more than 1000 tags._

From the `tags page`, you can browse all cliparts with a given tag. For instance, here are the [cliparts tagged with "work"](/tagged?tag=work).

#### The cliparts

Although <https://openclipart.org/> has been down for over 6 months, you can still find the original collection of 8000 cliparts dating back to 2005 at various sources.

The project is currently using SVGs found in the [openclipart 0.18 package](https://packages.debian.org/source/jessie/openclipart). I'm pointing to Debian Jessie, but later versions are identical.

All SVGs are in the **public domain**.

#### The source code

The [oca source code](https://github.com/millette/oca) can be found on GitHub and is licensed AGPLv3 by [Robin Millette](http://robin.millette.info/).

It's written in JavaScript using React on both the client and server sides with the help of Next.js.
